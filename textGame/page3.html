        <p>Since you had been running towards the station you picked up the napkin and dried off some sweat from your forehead.
            Unaware of the small scratch you got from the wild ping pong game earlier, some group A streptococci entered
            the wound. A few hours later the streptococci started producing gas and your skin surrounding the wound got blacker
            and spread until the bacteria had effectively
            <em>killed you off</em>.
